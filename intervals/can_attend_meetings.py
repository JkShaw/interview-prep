Meeting Rooms

Given an array of meeting time interval objects consisting of start and end times [[start_1,end_1],[start_2,end_2],...] (start_i < end_i), determine if a person could add all meetings to their schedule without any conflicts.

Note: (0,8),(8,10) is not considered a conflict at 8

Example 1:
Input: intervals = [(0,30),(5,10),(15,20)]
Output: false
Explanation:
(0,30) and (5,10) will conflict
(0,30) and (15,20) will conflict

Example 2:
Input: intervals = [(5,8),(9,15)]
Output: true

Constraints:
0 <= intervals.length <= 500
0 <= intervals[i].start < intervals[i].end <= 1,000,000
